# Polynom

# Description:
The project actually is about polynomial.
The project includes 3 classes:

*Polynom class- this class implement an interface class which called
"polynom_able". This class has some functions related to polynomial.
Some of the functions are:
Function that gets a number x and calculates the value of the
polynom at x.
Function that gets a number x and return the value of the derivative
of the polynom at x.
For more functions and explanations you are welcome to look at the
javadoc file which is attached to the project.


*Monom class- this class represent a "monom"
Monom class has some functions which related to monom.
Some of the functions are:
*Function that checks if two monoms are equal.
*Function that multiplies two monoms in each other.
For more functions and explanations you are welcome to look at the
javadoc file which is attached to the project.

*LinePlotTest class- This class has consructor that get 3 arguments: Object Polynom, int x, int x1.
The constructor gets the Polynom amd the range that difined by x and x1 and draws the graph between the range.
It also indicates the extreme points of the graph.
For drawing the graph i used the useful library called "gral".
The function does not draw a straight line.

*JunitTest class that checks if the methos of the project are  corect.

In addition the projects includes 3 interfaces:
*polynom_able which is implemented by polynom class.
*function which is implemented by monom class.
*cont_function


# Prerequisites:
Installation a workspace that works with java is needed.
You need to download the attached jar file called "gral".

# Running the tests:
A test file is attached to the project. You just need to run it.

# Built With:

Eclipse

# Authors:
Naor Eliav and michael garusi

# Acknowledgments:
In the project I used Wikipedia to write a number of functuations in
the class.
I checked what is "Reimann integral" to write the "area" function.
I used library called "garl".
